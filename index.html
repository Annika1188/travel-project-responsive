            <h3>Blue Mountians, World Heritage National Park</h3>
            <p>
              The Blue Mountains National Park is a protected national park that
              is located in the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales, in
              eastern Australia. The 267,954-hectare (662,130-acre) national
              park is situated approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) west of the
              Sydney CBD, and the park boundary is quite irregular as it is
              broken up by roads, urban areas and areas of private property.[3]
              Despite the name mountains, the area is an uplifted plateau,
              dissected by a number of larger rivers. The highest point in the
              park is Mount Werong at 1,215 metres (3,986 ft) above sea level;
              while the low point is on the Nepean River at 20 metres (66 ft)
              above sea level as it leaves the park.

                <p>
                  Before starting ‘fed blue mountains’ in 2016, both owners were
                  in education. They travelled long distances from the Blue
                  Mountains for work every day. They wanted to spend more time
                  in the picturesque Blue Mountains, not just on weekends, so
                  they purchased Fed Café and opened the doors of ‘fed blue
                  mountains’.

                  Food providence is important to us, as is showcasing the
                  amazing produce of the Blue Mountains and Central West.
                  Serving locally roasted coffee and meals featuring freshly
                  baked local bread, cheese, free-range eggs and more, we aim to
                  cater to the growing mass of consumers who care about where
                  their food has come from. Catering to the rising
                  health-consciousness of consumers, a range of dairy-free,
                  vegetarian and gluten-free menu items are also available.
                  Lovebites lives on a philosophy of ‘fresh tasty food for all’.

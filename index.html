            <h3>Blue Mountians, World Heritage National Park</h3>
            <p>
              The Blue Mountains National Park is a protected national park that
              is located in the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales, in
              eastern Australia. The 267,954-hectare (662,130-acre) national
              park is situated approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) west of the
              Sydney CBD, and the park boundary is quite irregular as it is
              broken up by roads, urban areas and areas of private property.[3]
              Despite the name mountains, the area is an uplifted plateau,
              dissected by a number of larger rivers. The highest point in the
              park is Mount Werong at 1,215 metres (3,986 ft) above sea level;
              while the low point is on the Nepean River at 20 metres (66 ft)
              above sea level as it leaves the park.
